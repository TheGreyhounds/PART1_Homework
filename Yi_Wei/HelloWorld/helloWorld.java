    //Yi's Reflection: How I think this whole thing work is that we created a
    //                 global class and a function under that class that returns nothing.
    //                 In that function, we told the computer to print onto the screen the
    //                 string literal hello world. To do this we called the println method
    //                 which takes in a string or value and prints it onto the screen.
