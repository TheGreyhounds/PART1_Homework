# PART1_Homework
This is where you'll push your assignments to, and where we'll critique one another's code.

If you don't already have a folder with your name in this repository, simply create the folder
on your computer, type the command
~~~
git pull origin master
~~~
And then type
~~~
git push origin master
~~~
To create your folder on the repository stored on GitHub.


Homework is mandatory. This may be a club, but it will operate as a class. To best prepare
yourselves for the Hackathon in February, you must complete the assignments given to you
every week. An hour meeting a week is not sufficient to learn programming, in any language, 
in just 5 months.

To enforce this fact, there will be a first-time warning system. The first time you do not complete 
your assignments before the Friday meeting they are due, you can give me your one-time warning pass. 
Every member of the club will be given one warning pass per term, which extends the assignment
deadline by one week. If the member does not make the assignment deadline a second time in
the same term, they will not be eligible to attend the Hackathon with the rest of the club
in February. This determination is subject to appeal on a case by case basis. 

Just do your homework guys, and it'll all be fine.
